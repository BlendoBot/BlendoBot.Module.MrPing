![GitHub Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/BlendoBot/BlendoBot.Module.MrPing/Tests)

Ever gotten accidentally pinged? Now you can give guild members a reason to ping people in the middle of the night! Create a Mr. Ping challenge and ping a lucky member until they either wake up or stop talking to you entirely!

## Discord Usage
- `?mrping` - Creates a new Mr. Ping challenge for a random victim.
- `?mrping list` - Lists the outstanding Mr. Ping challenges.
- `?mrping stats` - Shows some fun stats about how the guild has responded to Mr. Ping challenges.

After creating a Mr. Ping challenge, a random user will be asked to be pinged up to 100 times. In that channel, everyone must collectively ping that user that many times within 10 minutes. You can only ping once per message so you can't queue up pings. Don't get rate limited!
